Command line controller for [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/).

Basically, I wanted a quick way to temporarily disable my pi holes from the command line so I wouldn't have to hassle with opening a browser tab for every pi hole every time I need to temporarily disable ad blocking on my home network.

## Usage

`pihole-controller --server servername --password PASSWORD --seconds SECONDS_TO_DISABLE_PIHOLE`

The default number of seconds is 300.

You can also specify a settings file with` --configuration-file=/path/to/yaml/file`.

Currently the only settings are `password` and `servers`. Servers is a list of dns names or IP addresses of your pi holes.

See the example `pihole-controller.yaml` in this repository for an example.
